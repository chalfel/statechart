# StateChart Generator

`StateChart` is a command-line tool that scans Go projects for interfaces named `XStateMachine` (e.g., `OrderStateMachine`), parses their state transition definitions, and generates **Mermaid.js** diagrams to visualize state transitions.

## Features

- **Automatic Interface Detection**: Finds all interfaces named `XStateMachine` in `.go` files across your project.
- **Mermaid.js Output**: Generates `stateDiagram-v2` diagrams compatible with tools like GitHub, Notion, and VSCode.
- **Handles Inline Comments**: Extracts transition definitions from method comments.
- **Multi-File Support**: Processes multiple files and generates diagrams for each `XStateMachine` interface.
- **Customizable Output**: Save generated diagrams to a specified directory.

## Installation

Ensure you have Go installed, then install the tool:

```bash
go install github.com/yourusername/statechart/cmd@latest
```

---

## Usage

### Generate a Diagram for a Single File

To generate a Mermaid.js diagram from a single Go file:

```bash
statechart generate --file path/to/file.go --output path/to/output/file.mmd
```

- `--file`: Path to the Go file to process.
- `--output`: Path to save the Mermaid.js diagram (optional).

### Scan an Entire Project

To scan a project for all `XStateMachine` interfaces and generate diagrams:

```bash
statechart scan --project path/to/project --output path/to/output/directory
```

- `--project`: Path to the root directory of your project (default: current directory).
- `--output`: Directory to save the generated Mermaid diagrams (default: `./charts`).

## Example

### Input File: `order.go`

```go
package order

const (
	StatePending   = "Pending"
	StateConfirmed = "Confirmed"
	StateBlocked   = "Blocked"
)

// Pending, Registered -> Blocked
type OrderStateMachine interface {
	Block() error // Pending, Registered -> Blocked
	Confirm() error // Pending -> Confirmed
}

// Confirmed -> Archived
type ArchiveStateMachine interface {
	Archive() error // Confirmed -> Archived
}
```

### Generated Diagrams

#### `charts/orderstatemachine.mmd`

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Pending --> Blocked
    Registered --> Blocked
    Pending --> Confirmed
```

#### `charts/archivestatemachine.mmd`

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Confirmed -->|Archive| Archived
```

---

## Output Directory Structure

For a project with multiple `XStateMachine` interfaces across files, the output directory will look like:

```
charts/
â”œâ”€â”€ orderstatemachine.mmd
â”œâ”€â”€ archivestatemachine.mmd
â””â”€â”€ userstatemachine.mmd
```

---

## Mermaid.js Integration

Mermaid.js diagrams can be embedded into Markdown files for documentation:

```markdown
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Pending -->|Block| Blocked
    Registered -->|Block| Blocked
    Pending -->|Confirm| Confirmed
```
```

Use this in tools like GitHub, Notion, or VSCode to visualize the diagrams.
